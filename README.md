## Profile Guided Optimization (PGO)

Profile-guided optimizations (PGO) in a JVM employs profiling to understand execution-time program behavior and exploit that information to generate higher-quality code during code generation. We are studying the ratio of methods that are affected by PGOs by comparing generated object codes directly.
